### Repository Access
My repositories are private, but are accessible to those needing access to a specific repository.
Soon, they will be available to those who authenticate on my personal website, there's a setting to enable Developer Mode. Developer Mode will allow you to access all Developer Tools, including the Developer API, GitHub repositories (via GitHub Auth), and additional terminal commands. 
However, I am thinking of making more repostories open source.
